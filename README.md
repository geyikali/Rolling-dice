# Rolling-dice

This is a fun exercise: Roll a fair 6 faced die and you get paid the amount you rolled in dollars. Suppose you are to pay a price for each roll. How much would you be fine to pay for round 1? What about round 10? Or round 10^10? 

This repo contains three functions: one calculating the exact fair price for rolling the die n^th time, and two approximations (one discrete one continuous). It also has several tests to check which approximation performs better (guess which!).
